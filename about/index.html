 <div class="main_text"><p>I am an astrophysicist by trade but I decided to leave academia to pursue more creative work. As I always loved games and knew how to program I decided to start working in game design.</p>
<p>This led me to participate in a few game jams (see my <a href="https://camembear-games.itch.io/">itch.io</a> profile for some of my games) and develop a board game in collaboration with <a href="https://castoretpivert.fr/">Castor et Pivert</a>.</p>
<p>I also participated in a pitch jam in October 2023 organised by the <a href="https://www.stiftung-digitale-spielekultur.de/">Stiftung Digitale Spielekultur</a>. With my team we one the first prize and received some financial help to develop a prototype of a game that tackles the subject of value building during school recess. The game is under developement and more information will come soon.</p>
<p>I am now working full time of my first commercial game. The game will be a Pirate themed game with rogue-lite elements. You can subscribe to my newsletter to get updates on the developement:</p>
