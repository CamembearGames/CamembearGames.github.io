    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-10-7-in-the-newspaper/">Terraflip is in local news !</a></h2>
    <p>In September I went to a local game festival in my hometown to present and have people try out my board game <strong>Terraflip</strong>. It was a great festival with close to 600 visitors over the weekend.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-10-1-berlin-game-jam/">Welcome to Recess won a pitch Jam in Berlin</a></h2>
    Another month and another Jam.
In September I went to Berlin for a weekend pitch Jam organised by the Digital Gaming Culture Foundation (Stiftung digitale Spielekultur).
The objective was to pitch a game that we worked on for a little more than a day on the suject a Teaching Values.
We could work alone or as part of a team and joined 3 other participants and we worked together to pitch Welcome to Recess, a game about managing relationships in a schoolyard, discovering the mutiple storylines and playing minigames.
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2023-8-30-hathora-game-jam/">Puppy Rescue won the 2023 Hathora game Jam</a></h2>
    In August I participated in the Multiplayer Madness organised by Hathora (the full results can be found here). I just had some very rougth knowledge of multiplayer game creation but using Godot 4 mutiplayer api made it really smooth.
I wanted to make a coop non violent game with simplified graphics and I am quite happy with the results after 9 intensive days of game creation.
And it paid off because the game ended NÂ°1 of the game jam :)
